>>The story of [[ill or illa ( इल इला )]], as recounted by [[Shree Ram (श्री राम)]] to [[Lakshman (लक्ष्मण)]] and [[Bharata (भरत)]], is a tale of transformations, sacrifices, and divine interventions. It begins with King [[ill or illa ( इल इला )]], son of [[Kardam ( कर्दम )]], who while hunting in the forest, inadvertently enters a sacred space where Lord Shiv ( शिव ) and Parvati ( पार्वती ) are engaged in divine play. As a result of this intrusion, [[ill or illa ( इल इला ) | ill]] and his retinue are transformed into women.
>>
>>Seeking a resolution to this plight, [[ill or illa ( इल इला )]] beseeches Lord Shiv ( शिव ) and Parvati ( पार्वती ) for a solution. Parvati ( पार्वती ) grants him a boon, allowing him to alternate between male and female forms every month. Thus, Ila lives as both man and woman, experiencing different aspects of life.
>>
>>During his time as a woman, [[ill or illa ( इल इला )]] encounters [[Budh (बुध)]], the son of the Moon (चन्द्रमा), who becomes enamored with her beauty. They spend a month together, and [[ill or illa ( इल इला ) | ill]] gives birth to a son named [[Pururava (पुरुरवा)]].
>>
>>Later, [[Budh (बुध)]] advises Ila to perform the Ashvamedh (अश्वमेध यज्ञ ) to appease Lord Shiv ( शिव ) and regain his manhood permanently. With the help of sages and the performance of the sacrifice, Lord Shiv ( शिव ) is pleased and restores [[ill or illa ( इल इला ) | ill]]'s masculinity.
>>
>>Following this, [[ill or illa ( इल इला )]] founds the city of Pratishthan (प्रतिष्ठान पुर ) and passes away, leaving his son [[Pururava (पुरुरवा)]] as his successor. The story emphasizes the power of Ashvamedh (अश्वमेध यज्ञ ), divine intervention, and the cyclical nature of life and gender transformation.
